## Contents
- ```team-photos``` contains two images of our team (an official photo and one funny photo with all of our team members)
- ```video``` contains a link to a video on YouTube that demonstrates how our vehicle operates.
- ```models``` include 3D-printed replicas of our car's parts.
- ```schemes``` contains all of our schematic diagram of the electromechanical parts that show all the parts (motors, electronics, and other electromechanical components) used in the vehicle and their connections.
- ```src``` contain all of source code of our vehicle. (Python source code)

## Introduction 


## Models
- ```base with nut hole.STL``` The STL file is the base component that will be used to attach the electronic mounter component to the vehicle base.
- ```step down mount.STL``` The component that will be mounted to the electronic mounter base is this. This is used to insert a step-down DC to DC converter.

## Electronic
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (OS : Raspberry Pi OS 64-bits) 1 ea. 
- Battery (18650 Lithium-ion battery) 3 ea.
- USB HD Camera (720p camera) 1 ea.
- DC to DC step down converter (from 9VDC - 36VDC to 5VDC 3A) 1 ea.
- Motor Driver Module (L298N) 1 ea.
- DC Motor (12VDC) 1 ea.
- Servo Motor (MG996R) 1 ea.

How all electronic components are wired show in schematic diagrams in ```schemes``` directory.
In ```schemes``` directory, ```diagram_fritzing.png``` is the property diagram from Fritzing program and ```Easy Diagram.pdf``` is a easy diagram of our circuit.
